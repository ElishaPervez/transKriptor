# Optional: For enhanced GPU performance
# For RTX 50 series support, use ONNX Runtime with appropriate CUDA support
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.18.0; sys_platform == "win32"
onnxruntime>=1.18.0; sys_platform != "win32"

# Optional: For TensorRT optimization (NVIDIA GPUs) - Updated for RTX 50 series
# RTX 50 series (Blackwell) requires TensorRT 10.x
tensorrt>=10.0.0; sys_platform == "win32"

# Audio processing
librosa>=0.10.0

# IMPORTANT: PyTorch installation for RTX 50 series
# For RTX 50 series (Blackwell architecture), standard PyTorch releases do not include support
# You MUST install PyTorch separately with CUDA 12.8+ support before installing other requirements:
# 
# For RTX 50 series, install PyTorch nightly with CUDA 12.8:
# pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
#
# For older GPUs, you can install a standard version:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
