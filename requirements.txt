# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.21.0
# For RTX 50 series support, install PyTorch nightly or build from source with CUDA 12.8+
# Example: pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
torch>=2.0.0 

faster-whisper>=1.0.0  # Updated version with better compatibility
transformers>=4.21.0
tokenizers>=0.12.1
sounddevice>=0.4.6

# Optional: For enhanced GPU performance
# For RTX 50 series support, use ONNX Runtime with appropriate CUDA support
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.18.0; sys_platform == "win32"
onnxruntime>=1.18.0; sys_platform != "win32"

# Optional: For TensorRT optimization (NVIDIA GPUs) - Updated for RTX 50 series
# RTX 50 series (Blackwell) requires TensorRT 10.x
tensorrt>=10.0.0; sys_platform == "win32"

# Audio processing
librosa>=0.10.0

# Installation notes for RTX 50 series support:
# For RTX 50 series (Blackwell architecture), standard PyTorch releases do not yet include support
# You will need to:
# 1. Use PyTorch nightly builds with CUDA 12.8+ support
# 2. OR build PyTorch from source with CUDA 12.8+
# 3. OR wait for official support in PyTorch 2.8+ (expected release)

# For CUDA 12.8 PyTorch nightly (example command):
# pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
