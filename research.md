# Research Summary: Whisper Transcription Assistant

## Objective
Build a desktop-wide transcription assistant powered by the Whisper model that activates via a hotkey and transcribes live microphone input into text, optimized for modern GPUs (including RTX 50 series) with lazy loading and automatic model unloading.

## Step 1: Preliminary Research Findings

### 1.1 Whisper Model Dependencies and RTX 50-Series Compatibility

**Framework Dependencies:**
- PyTorch: Required for Whisper models (recommended version 2.0+ for optimal CUDA support)
- CUDA: 11.8 or 12.x depending on PyTorch version compatibility
- cuDNN: Compatible versions with PyTorch/CUDA combination
- Python: 3.8-3.11 for optimal package compatibility

**RTX 50-Series Compatibility:**
- RTX 50 series (Blackwell architecture) uses sm_120 compute capability
- Standard PyTorch releases do NOT officially support RTX 50 series
- Tensor Core support: 9th gen Tensor Cores support FP4, FP8, and traditional FP16/BF16 operations
- VRAM: 16GB+ for high-end models, allowing for larger model sizes
- Architecture: Blackwell architecture has improved AI inference capabilities
- Driver support: Requires latest NVIDIA drivers (550.x+)

**Compatibility Assessment:**
- Whisper implementations (OpenAI Whisper, faster-whisper) can work with RTX 50-series when PyTorch is properly configured
- RTX 50 series requires special PyTorch installation:
  1. Use nightly builds with CUDA 12.8+ support
  2. Build PyTorch from source with compatible CUDA version
  3. Wait for official support in PyTorch 2.8+ (expected release)
- Memory management is improved due to larger VRAM capacity
- Performance gains expected from enhanced Tensor Cores and architecture improvements

### 1.2 Tensor Core Utilization Methods

**TensorRT:**
- NVIDIA's inference optimizer
- Can provide 2-7x speedup with minimal accuracy loss
- Supports FP16, INT8, and potentially FP8 for RTX 50-series
- Requires model export and conversion process

**Mixed Precision (FP16/BF16):**
- Native PyTorch AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) support
- Significant speedup with minimal code changes
- BF16 provides better stability for training, FP16 for inference
- RTX 50-series will have enhanced FP16 performance

**CUDA Graphs:**
- Reduces kernel launch overhead
- Particularly effective for repetitive inference tasks
- Can improve Whisper's chunked inference performance
- Requires PyTorch 1.10+ with CUDA graphs API

**ONNX Runtime:**
- Cross-platform inference engine
- Supports TensorRT, CUDA, and CPU execution providers
- Quantization support for model optimization
- Can provide performance improvements over raw PyTorch

### 1.3 Module and Library Compatibility

**Audio Input:**
- PyAudio: Popular but has installation challenges with PyPI
- sounddevice: Modern, clean API, good for real-time streaming
- pydub: Good for audio processing, but may add overhead
- SpeechRecognition: Higher-level, but less control over streaming

**Hotkey Handling:**
- pynput: Cross-platform, good for global hotkeys
- keyboard: Windows-focused, extensive features
- PyQt: Can handle global hotkeys, plus UI components
- system_hotkey: Lightweight dedicated solution

**UI Overlay:**
- PyQt/PySide: Mature, cross-platform, good for overlays
- Tkinter: Built-in, simple but limited styling
- Dear PyGui: Modern GPU-accelerated GUI library
- Kivy: Cross-platform with GPU acceleration

**GPU Acceleration:**
- PyTorch: Native CUDA support, easy to implement
- ONNX Runtime: Optimized execution with multiple backends
- TensorRT: Best performance but more complex setup
- CTranslate2: Optimized inference for Transformer models

### 1.4 Known Issues and Limitations

**RTX 50-Series Specific:**
- Early driver support may have stability issues
- PyTorch may need updates for full Blackwell architecture optimization
- CUDA 12.6+ may have breaking changes from CUDA 11.x
- TensorRT may need updates for new architecture

**Whisper Model Specific:**
- Large models (large-v2, large-v3) require 8GB+ VRAM
- Real-time processing requires chunked inference
- Latency optimization crucial for desktop experience
- Model loading times can be several seconds to minutes

**Development Environment:**
- Windows may have more dependency installation issues
- Different GPU memory management between platforms
- Audio input APIs vary significantly across platforms
- Global hotkey handling has OS-specific requirements
