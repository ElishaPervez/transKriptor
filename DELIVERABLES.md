# Whisper Transcription Assistant - Project Summary

## Objective
Built a desktop-wide transcription assistant powered by the Whisper model that activates via a hotkey and transcribes live microphone input into text, optimized for modern GPUs (including RTX 50 series) with intelligent resource management.

## Deliverables

### 1. Research Summary

**Compatibility Findings for Whisper and RTX 50-series GPUs:**
- Whisper models are compatible with RTX 50-series when PyTorch is properly configured
- Standard PyTorch releases do NOT officially support RTX 50 series (sm_120 architecture)
- TensorRT optimization will provide significant performance gains on RTX 50-series
- 9th gen Tensor Cores support FP4, FP8, and traditional FP16 operations
- Expected 16GB+ VRAM on high-end models will support larger Whisper variants
- To run on RTX 50 series, one of these is required:
  1. Use PyTorch nightly builds with CUDA 12.8+ support
  2. Build PyTorch from source with compatible CUDA version
  3. Wait for official support in PyTorch 2.8+ (expected release)

**Final Tech Stack and Reasoning:**
- Core: Python 3.8+ with PyTorch for GPU acceleration (special installation needed for RTX 50)
- Whisper Implementation: faster-whisper for optimized inference
- Audio Input: sounddevice for real-time audio capture
- UI: PyQt5 for cross-platform overlay interface
- Hotkey: pynput for global hotkey detection
- GPU Optimization: ONNX Runtime and TensorRT support built-in

### 2. Full Application Source Code
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Core, audio, model, UI, hotkey, config, utils, and test modules
- Comprehensive documentation in docstrings
- Event-driven architecture for inter-component communication

### 3. Build Instructions

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for installation from source)

**Installation Steps:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` and activate it
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. For GPU acceleration: Install PyTorch with CUDA support
5. Run: `python main.py`

### 4. Key Features Implemented

**Architecture Components:**
- Launcher/Background Service: Main application coordinator
- Global Hotkey Manager: System-wide hotkey handling
- Overlay UI: Lightweight transcription display
- Audio Subsystem: Real-time microphone input processing
- Model Manager: Lazy loading and auto-unloading of Whisper models
- Transcription Pipeline: Real-time audio-to-text processing
- Output Sink: Clipboard and window integration
- Configuration System: Persistent user settings
- Logging System: Performance and diagnostic tracking

**Resource Management:**
- Lazy loading: Models load only when needed
- Auto-unloading: 5-minute timeout by default
- GPU optimization: Mixed precision and TensorRT support
- Memory efficient: Audio buffering and processing

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Real-time processing with minimal latency
- GPU-accelerated inference
- Voice activity detection to reduce unnecessary processing
- Efficient VRAM management

### 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Windows support primary with cross-platform architecture
- Modular design enables easy porting to Linux/macOS
- Platform-specific optimizations while maintaining consistency

## Usage Instructions

1. Run `python main.py` to start the application
2. Press Ctrl+Alt+T (default) to activate transcription
3. Speak into microphone and see real-time transcription
4. Press hotkey again to stop transcription

## Configuration Options

The application uses a JSON config file with the following options:
- Hotkey binding
- Model size selection (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- Device selection (auto, cuda, cpu)
- Compute precision (float16, float32, int8)
- Unload timeout
- Audio settings
- VAD settings
- Output mode

## Future Enhancements

- Additional output modes (file, API, etc.)
- Advanced audio processing (noise reduction, speaker diarization)
- Multiple language support enhancements
- Advanced UI themes and customization
- System tray integration
- Auto-startup options
